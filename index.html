                    <p><q>The <span class="red">Kaedehara Clan</span> was once a famed samurai clan. It's a pity that by the time the noble name passed to me, the title itself was all that was left. But it is enough for me. A samurai has no need of a lavish life — we find all that we need in wine, song, and the blade in our hands.</span></q></p>

            <p class="text-center alt-font mw80 pd1em bg-red yellow rounded">Even Beidou, ever the good judge of character, could not tell that Kazuha could wield a sword with the skill of a seasoned warrior when she first decided to take him in.</p>

            <p class="text-center alt-font mg1em">Who knows if it was the storms of life that smoothed out his rough edges, or if his natural restraint has kept his edge sheathed.</p>

            <p class="text-center alt-font line-top red">After all, he is a gentle soul who enjoys reciting poetry when idle, and who speaks to everyone in a leisurely manner. Who could tell that he is a wanted man throughout Inazuma?

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The Crux,</b> an armed fleet from Liyue, spends much of the year on the high seas, and its sailors are quite used to the vagaries of life in other nations. So they were more curious than surprised when an outlander began serving as a sailor on their flagship, the Alcor.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The</b> sailor in question was picked up when the Alcor docked at the Inazuman port of Ritou.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Beidou</b> had made friends with this young man, and when he came on board, she told her crew, "This guy's gonna be staying with us for a while. Take care of him, now."
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The</b> sailors trusted Beidou's judgment and admired the newcomer for his martial prowess, not to mention his ability to predict the weather, so they were happy to overlook his reticence to discuss his past, and welcomed him aboard.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Still,</b> their curiosity did not abate, and they would often find all sorts of excuses to try and ply him for information about his experiences.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">"<b>I've</b> heard that they make some sweet blades there in Inazuma and that the bigger the fish you are, the swankier the sword. So, uh... how's yours measure up?"
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">"<b>...</b>"
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Kazuha</b> would remain silent in the face of all such queries.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Over time,</b> after countless attempts to garner a response proved futile, the sailors would simply give up asking.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Eventually,</b> it was an off-the-cuff remark from Chief Mate, Juza, just a few days later that finally managed to elicit a reply.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">"<b>Hey</b>, Inazuma boy. What are the lads supposed to call you if they don't even know your name?"
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The</b> young sailor wiped the sweat from his brow with his callused hands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">"<b>My</b> name is Kaedehara Kazuha, a wandering samurai. I am in your debt for taking me in, so just call me 'Kazuha.'"

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Kazuha</b> was not born a commoner. He hails from an Inazuman noble house of old, the last son of the Kaedehara Clan.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Inazuma</b> City is home to many illustrious clans, and the Kaedehara name was once one of the most renowned among them. But fortune is fickle, and the Kaedeharas' fortunes had already collapsed by the time they were Kazuha's to inherit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>As</b> the young master of the house, Kazuha could do nothing but watch as his family's future crumbled around him. But as helpless as this made him feel, when the moment came that the home was officially repossessed and the last attendant was finally dismissed, he breathed a sigh of relief: As far as he was concerned, this was a golden opportunity to begin leading a free and wandering life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>He</b> had always longed to roam the mountains and forests, and had held a deep admiration for the beauty and authenticity of nature since his youth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>To</b> Kazuha, nature had never been silent. It had always spoken to him, conveying its feelings in its own unique language.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>When</b> the wind ceases to speak and the world falls silent, that is the calm before the skies begin to weep. When silent springs suddenly leap into activity, it is the omen of a great earthquake.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>These</b> are the unique poetics that nature has bestowed upon him, and Kazuha was never one to be preoccupied with luxury anyway — so if the burden of family responsibility should drop from his shoulders, why not go wandering, and travel light?
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Thus</b> did Kazuha strike out on his journey, like a falling leaf in the yard carried away by the wind.

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>All</b> travelers who outdoors roam need some skill to call their own. For Kazuha, this is his ability to read the sounds of nature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>After</b> leaving Inazuma City, Kazuha wandered here and there. Things were different now: all of nature was his treasured home, and the sounds of wind and water beneath the sight of drifting clouds set his heart at ease.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>All</b> that he saw on the road filled him with curiosity. It was in this state of mind that Kazuha arrived at a mountain in the south.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>It</b> was early summer, and the frequent and heavy rainfall had turned the mountain roads to mud. Seeing that night was soon to fall, Kazuha decided to find somewhere to shelter from the rain. No sooner had he had this thought than he turned around to see a small straw hut at the far end of the road.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The</b> traveling merchant with whom he was traveling at that time whooped for joy at the sight of the hut: "Kazuha, look! We'll have a roof over our heads tonight!"
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>But</b> Kazuha did not speak. He paused and listened intently for a long while before he finally replied: "If you were to ask my opinion... it may be best to stay away."
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>But</b> the merchant did not wish to remain in the rain. He left Kazuha and made his way to the house.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Upon</b> knocking at the door, the traveling merchant was met by a lovely woman who offered him shelter, tea, food, and even bedding for the night.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Perhaps</b> it was the excellent food, but the merchant quickly became drowsy and fell asleep immediately after finishing his meal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>When</b> he awoke the following morning, there was no roof over his head. The bright sunlight pierced his eyes, and all he could see was Kazuha standing nearby, looking down at him and smiling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Before</b> the merchant could speak, he vomited a great pile of leaves and mud. And as for the bedding upon which he had slept so soundly, ah, it too was mud.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Kazuha</b> smiled and said: "The wind is weaker where there are houses. Yet here stood a hut, and there was no change in the mountain breeze. I think you might have been the victim of a bake-danuki's prank. Never mind. Next time, listen more closely to the wind and tread with care."

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Kazuha</b> made many friends during his travels. One of them was particularly close to his heart, and for a time, the two journeyed together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>But</b> they too would part, for their destinations were different.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>To</b> have met merely by chance and then form such a strong bond, there must be a fated connection between them... so, although they would part ways for now, surely they would meet again. Or so Kazuha thought.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>But</b> something happened soon thereafter that would shatter his calm disposition — the Almighty Shogun promulgated the Vision Hunt Decree and swore to retrieve all Visions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>All</b> who wielded them, including Kazuha, were stricken with panic, concealing their identities and going into hiding.

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>It</b> was then that Kazuha received shocking news: Someone had dared to call for a "duel before the throne," and that someone was none other than Kazuha's dear friend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>The</b> defeated party in a duel before the throne would face punishment at the hand of the Shogun herself. His friend was prepared to risk all to come before the throne, partly for the chance to fight against a strong foe, but also to demonstrate the meaning of courage to all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>And</b> yet, to call for this challenge now, of all times... Kazuha feared that his punishment, should he fail, would be absolute: The Almighty Shogun would unleash her lightning upon him in its full fury, and it would surely take his life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Even</b> the normally calm Kazuha could not restrain himself. He drew his sword and stormed into Tenshukaku like a whirlwind... But alas, he arrived too late.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>His</b> friend's sword lay shattered in pieces, his Vision now an empty husk. Now a wanted man himself, Kazuha fled with grief in his heart.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>From</b> that moment on, the days of peaceful wanderings were over, and Kazuha's life became an unending series of battles.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>Kazuha</b> did not fear battle, of course, but the constant fighting left him feeling lost and perplexed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><b>He</b> did not regret having set out on his doomed rescue mission, nor did he begrudge his friend for leaving him, but he could not help but think...

                                    <p><q>I've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god.</q></p>

As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?</q></p>

                        <p><q>I heard it was your birthday, so I wrote a haiku for you. Unfortunately, I'm not the most talented in this area, and after trying for several evenings, I was still only able to come up with the first two lines... I guess I'll just share what I've got so far, then. "Sun and moon rejoice / Birds of dawn sing songs anew"... Wait, don't say a word, I think the final line is coming to me... Yes, how about.... "Far from home, with you." Anyway, Happy Birthday. Let's go and get you some cake, shall we?</q></p>
